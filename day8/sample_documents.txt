Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data.

Key Concepts in AI:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Understanding and generating human language
2. Computer Vision - Analyzing and interpreting visual information
3. Robotics - Creating machines that can interact with the physical world
4. Expert Systems - Programs that can make decisions in complex domains

Modern Applications:
- Virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant
- Recommendation systems used by Netflix and Amazon
- Self-driving cars from Tesla and Waymo
- Medical diagnosis systems that can detect diseases from images

The future of AI includes more advanced general intelligence, better human-AI collaboration, and ethical considerations around AI development and deployment.
