# Structured Output Fixes - Summary

## Problems Identified

### 1. JSON Format Issue
The original structured output implementation was failing with validation errors like:
```
Structured API request failed: 1 validation error for BasicResponse
Invalid JSON: expected value at line 2 column 1 [type=json_invalid, input_value='\n```json\n{...']
```

The GLM API was returning JSON wrapped in markdown code blocks (````json...```), but LangChain's `with_structured_output()` expected raw JSON.

### 2. Model Dump Attribute Error
After fixing the JSON parsing, a new error occurred:
```
"'dict' object has no attribute 'model_dump'"
```

This happened because `JsonOutputParser` returns dictionaries, but the code was calling `.model_dump()` which only exists on Pydantic models.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **JSON Extraction Function**
- Added `extract_json_from_markdown()` function to handle multiple JSON formats:
  - JSON in ````json...``` code blocks
  - JSON in ````...``` code blocks without language specifier
  - Raw JSON embedded in text
  - Fallback extraction between `{` and `}` braces

### 2. **Robust Two-Stage Approach**
- **Primary**: Use `JsonOutputParser` with explicit instructions to output raw JSON
- **Fallback**: If primary fails, get raw response and extract JSON from markdown
- **Validation**: Schema validation using Pydantic models

### 3. **Enhanced System Prompts**
- Clear instructions to avoid markdown formatting
- Multiple explicit warnings about not using code blocks
- Emphasis on outputting raw JSON only
- Comprehensive response requirements

### 4. **Universal Response Handling**
- Updated `display_structured_response()` to handle both Pydantic models and dictionaries
- Dynamic attribute checking with `hasattr()` for compatibility
- Universal extraction of confidence scores and follow-up questions

### 5. **Better Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback with detailed error messages
- Structured error responses that maintain the schema pattern
- Multiple parsing strategies to ensure reliability

## Key Code Changes

### New Imports
```python
import json
import re
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
```

### JSON Extraction Function
```python
def extract_json_from_markdown(text: str) -> dict:
    """Extract JSON content from markdown code blocks."""
    # Handles ```json...```, ````...``` and raw JSON formats
```

### Enhanced Structured Chat Method
- Uses `JsonOutputParser` with `pydantic_object` for schema validation
- Explicit prompt instructions to avoid markdown
- Fallback mechanism for markdown-wrapped responses

### Improved System Messages
```python
"You are a helpful assistant that provides structured responses. "
"Respond with valid JSON that matches the {schema_class.__name__} schema. "
"IMPORTANT: Output ONLY raw JSON without markdown formatting, backticks, or code blocks. "
"Be comprehensive, accurate, and provide complete responses that fully address the user's request."
```

## Testing Results
✅ **All JSON extraction tests pass:**
- JSON from markdown code blocks with language specifier
- JSON from markdown code blocks without language specifier
- Raw JSON extraction from plain text
- Proper error handling for invalid JSON

✅ **Display method compatibility tests pass:**
- Handles both Pydantic models (from fallback mechanism)
- Handles dictionaries (from JsonOutputParser)
- Properly displays confidence scores and follow-up questions from both formats
- Graceful handling of missing optional fields

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Reliability**: Multiple parsing strategies ensure structured output works consistently
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Doesn't break existing functionality
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks with meaningful error messages
4. **Better UX**: Clearer error messages and more reliable structured responses
5. **Maintains Schema Validation**: Still ensures responses match Pydantic schemas

## Usage
The structured output functionality now works reliably with the GLM API. Users can:
- Toggle structured mode with `/structured`
- Get properly formatted JSON responses
- See confidence scores and follow-up questions
- Handle errors gracefully with structured error responses

The implementation now handles the reality that some LLMs (including GLM) naturally respond with markdown-wrapped JSON, while still providing the clean, structured output that users expect.
